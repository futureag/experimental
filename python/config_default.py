# MVP Configuration

# This configuration file contains settings that control the operation of the mvp system.
# Nothing in the file needs to be changed from the default values in order to operate your MVP, 
# however if you wish to change the defaults or use additional features then follow the
# instructions below for the thing that you wish to change or enable.
#
# Note that there are often comments located near each setting contained in this file.
# Consult those comments for additional information.
#
# 1) device_name: Set this to something short that identifies your mvp and differentiates it. The
#                 default value is mvp.  
# 2) Light cycle.  Edit the light_controller_program value to specify the light cycle that you desire.
#                  The standard light cycle is on from 5:00 PM (local time) to 11:00 AM the next morning,
#                  and then off for 6 hours before the cycle repeats.
#
# 3) Camera picture cycle: The system defaults to taking one picture per hour at the beginning of the
#                          of the hour. The only thing that can be changed is to specify a different 
#                          minute within the hour when the picture is taken. 
#                          Edit the camera_controller_program settings to specify a different minute
#                          of the hour at which pictures should be taken.
#
# 4) Fan Controller: The fan is turned on when the max_air_temperature is exceeded and is turned off
#                    whe the temperature drops below this value.  Change the value of max_air_temperature
#                    to modify the set point for the fan.
#
# 5) Data Sample Interval: By default the system takes temperature and humidity measurements every 
#                          20 minutes. To change this edit the data_logger_sample_interval value.
#
# 6) Charting Interval: By default the web site charts for temperature and humidity are updated every
#                       30 minutes.  Edit the charting_interval value to change this.
#
# 7) MQTT data logging: By default MQTT data logging is turned off.  In order to turn it on do the
#                       following:
#                       1) enable_mqtt -> set to True
#                       2) organization_guid -> This value is sent as part of the mqtt topic.
#                       3) device_id ->  Set it to some unique value such as a guid.
#                       4) si7021_device_id -> Set it to some unique value such as a guid.
#                       5) log_data_via_mqtt -> set to True
#                       6) mqtt_url and mqtt_port -> Obtain these from your mqqt broker administrator. 
#                       7) mqtt_username and "password" -> Get these from your mqtt broker administrator.
#                          You can use either plaintext or enrypted passwords (restrictions apply).

# Included in topics (e.g data/v1/[organization_guid).  If you don't want it in the topic

#
# Use the following command in order to encrypt the MQTT password.
# echo "put the password here" | openssl enc -e  -k "put your passphrase here" -a -aes-256-cbc
#
# Remember the passphrase and keep it secure. The mvp system will prompt you for the passphrase
# when it is started and use it to decrypt the MQTT password.
# 
# After you generate the encrypted password then modify the value for "encrypted_mqtt_password"
# to be the value that you generated.
